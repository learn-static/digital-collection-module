## About Digital Exhibit Lab

This Learn-Static template is designed to teach digital scholarship concepts via an experience creating a digital collection.
Students are invited to do archival research, curation, description, and metadata, resulting in a final published digital exhibit website.

The project can be framed in different ways to emphasize various aspects of the process or learn specific digital skills.

This template is based on [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets), a framework for creating digital exhibits driven by a metadata spreadsheet.
Powered by a static web approach, CollectionBuilder minimizes the technical overhead, maintenance, and complexity--if hosted on GitHub (or similar code hosting service), creating a project does not require a server or installing software.
This enables individual instructors, librarians, DH labs, or even the students themselves to set up the project.

For a demonstration of the learning sequence used in a course see ["Mining the Archives", History 454](https://thecdil.github.io/hist-454-2022/).

## The Assignment

History 454's *Mining the Archives* project involves several components:

- **Archival Research:** Working with [U of I Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/), students explore and do hands on research with primary source materials related to mining.
- **Digitization:** From their archival research, students select at least one photograph and one text source to digitize. Working with the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) (CDIL), they scan their selected items and prepare digital files. Browse [digitized objects]({{ '/browse.html#Digitization Project' | relative_url }}).
- **Curation:** Students explore [U of I Library Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/collections.html) and select five additional items from existing digital collections, creating metadata for their curated records. Browse [curated objects]({{ '/browse.html#Curation Project' | relative_url }}).
- **Description and Metadata:** Students create metadata following a collection template to describe their digitized and curated items.
- **Exhibit:** Once all objects and metadata are submitted, CDIL generates the final digital collection (this site!). 
- **Research and Reflection:** Students write papers and reflections informed by their archival research.
