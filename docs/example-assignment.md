# Mining the Archive: Digital Archive Project Guidelines History 454, Spring 2022 

> updated: 1/27/2022

The historical archive is a repository of memory – shaping in profound ways what we can know about the past. But historical archives are always changing. Sometimes, changes come about as historical societies and university libraries acquire new collections, creating a deeper and richer landscape of materials for the historian to investigate. In other instances, the very format of the archive undergoes transformation, as in the case of the rise of digital collections over the past few decades. This newfound world of digital archives presents powerful new opportunities for historical research – as anyone with an internet connection now has access to a dizzying wealth of documents – as it raises compelling questions about how we make meaning from the traces of history. Understanding the digital archive is especially crucial for grasping the history of American photography, given the rapid digitization of photographs and the capacity of such photographs to become untethered from their historical contexts. 

In this project, we will explore the nature and power of the digital archive by actually creating a digital archive. We will do so by drawing upon original primary source material – both written and photographic – from UI Special Collections. Since one of the key strengths of our Special Collections is the history of mining, we will make that history the focal point of our work. 

The project will unfold in a series of steps: 

**Monday, Feb. 28: Meet at UI Special Collections**

- Receive an overview of the collections for the project. 
- The collections: 
    - Bunker Hill Mining Company
        - Box 75 
    - Stanley Easton Papers
        - Box 1, Folders 1-40
    - Barnard-Stockbridge Collection
        - 8 – A71 to 8 – A 151
        - 8-x532 to 8-x550

**Wednesday, March 2: Meet at UI Special Collections**

- Explore collections 

**Friday, March 4: Meet at UI Special Collections**

- Explore collections. 
- By this point you should have selected the sources you plan to digitize: one photograph and one written source.

**Monday, March 7: Meet at Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (second floor of library)**

- Introduction to CDIL
- Overview of CollectionBuilder concepts and how it fits into the digital collection project
- Overview of digitization and metadata concepts 

**Wednesday, March 9: Meet at Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (second floor of library)**

- Digitization process instruction
- Work on digitization

**Friday, March 11: Meet at Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (second floor of library)**

- Curation process instruction and metadata
- Work on curation of items
- Work on metadata

**Friday, April 1: digitization work DUE (by midnight PST)**

- Complete digitization of one photograph, one written source
- Complete and submit metadata for two digitized items and five curated items

**Monday, April 4: Meet at Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (second floor of library)**

- Review final digital collection
    - Browse website
    - Discuss refining metadata to fix issues
    - Intro to code and how it works
- Discuss the experience
- Cover ways to cite and use collection items in writing

**Friday, April 22: archive paper and reflection DUE (by midnight PST)**

- This paper (3-5 pages double spaced) should address the following question: were relations between mining companies and their employees primarily characterized by conflict or consensus? 
- In addressing this question, you should develop an argument backed by written and visual evidence. Importantly, you must draw upon primary sources to make your argument, and you are only allowed to use the archive we have created. You should also feel free to draw upon the Aiken reading for context. 
- Alongside this paper, students will write a 1-page reflection that considers the role of the archive itself in shaping what one can illuminate about the history of mining. Here are a few questions to consider for this reflection: which sources were the easiest to use, and which posed the greatest problems? How did the availability of certain sources in our archive shape what you could argue? If the archive had included different sources, would your argument have differed?
