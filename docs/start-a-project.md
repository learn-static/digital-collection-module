# How to Set Up a digital-exhibit-lab project

To start your Digital Exhibit Lab project you will be creating your own copy of the template code.
The best/fastest way to do this is to visit the [digital-exhibit-lab repository](https://github.com/learn-static/digital-exhibit-lab) on GitHub and click the green "Use This Template" button.

## Generate from Template

1. Login to your account on [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Visit the digital-exhibit-lab repository: <https://github.com/learn-static/digital-exhibit-lab> 
3. On the repository home page, click the green "Use This Template" button (appears on right side above the code area).
4. This brings you to a "Create a new repository" page. Fill out using these options:
    1. **Repository name**: Use a lowercase name *without* spaces or odd characters. When hosting on GitHub, this name will become part of your site URL, so think through how it will look as a link!
    2. Most users should choose "Public" repository. If you are hosting on GitHub Pages it *must* be public unless you upgrade to a paid account.
    3. Leave the "Include all branches" option **Unchecked**! (you do not want all branches, only the main branch)
    4. Click on the green button "**Create repository from template**". 
    
With that final click, you will be redirected to your new repository!

## Alternative Setup

*Please note,* using the template button is the fastest way to set up a project on GitHub. 
However, there are alternative, more manual methods to copy the code into your own repository.
This might be of interest if you aren't using GitHub for your project.

By clicking the "Code" button on the repository, you are given options to "Download" the code (meaning you will have a zip file with the complete code) or "Clone" the project (meaning you will have the complete git repository).
The code can then be manually copied into your own repository or project location.
This may be useful if you do not want to use GitHub.

Using GitHub's "fork" option should be reserved for situations where you would like to edit the template itself and contribute your changes back to the project via a Pull Request.

## Add a GitHub Collaborator

Most projects are collaborative, so you will probably want to add your collaborators to your GitHub project repository.
In some cases this might be a librarian setting up a project and an instructor. 
If students are directly contributing to the project (i.e. not just the metadata), you will need to add them as well.

1. On the repository home page, click "Settings" tab
2. On left side nav, click "Manage access"
3. Click the green "invite teams or people" button
4. Type in a GitHub user name to add. The search bar will show suggestions based on what you type, select the correct account to add.
5. Select their level of access to the repository. Generally if you want people to be able to edit code in the repository, give them "Write" access. Then click the green "Add" button.

Once added your collaborator will receive an email with the invitation to join your repository.
They will have to confirm the invitation before being added!
