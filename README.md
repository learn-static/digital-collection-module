# digital-exhibit-lab

This Learn-Static template is designed to teach digital scholarship concepts via an experience creating a digital collection.
Students are invited to do archival research, curation, description, and metadata, resulting in a final published digital exhibit website.
The project can be framed in different ways to emphasize various aspects of the process or learn specific digital skills.

This template is based on [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets), a framework for creating digital exhibits driven by a metadata spreadsheet.
Powered by a static web approach, CollectionBuilder minimizes the technical overhead, maintenance, and complexity--if hosted on GitHub (or similar code hosting service), creating a project does not require a server or installing software.
This enables individual instructors, librarians, DH labs, or even the students themselves to set up the project.

For a demonstration of the learning sequence used in a course see ["Mining the Archives", History 454](https://thecdil.github.io/hist-454-2022/).
