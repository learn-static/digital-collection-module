# digital-collection-module

A Learn-Static module to teach digital scholarship concepts via an experience creating a digital collection.

This module is based on [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets), a project template for creating digital exhibits driven by a metadata spreadsheet.
The resulting website can directly parse a Google Sheet, enabling live collaboration and prototyping with minimal set up.
